/**
 * This is a C/C++ biding from the Rustreexo library
 * (https://github.com/mit-dci/rustreexo). It implements utreexo's logic in
 * Rust, and exposes a relatively sane interface for consumers. Functions only
 * returns 0/1 or void, all returns are made using output pointers.
 * This gives more flexibility to what can we do on the implementation side,
 * especially return more than one data in a easy way. Some key considerations
 * about it:
 *
 * 1 - Output pointers always come first. If the function has one or more
 *     outputs, they will be made using a user provided pointer. No
 *     allocation is required for this pointer, the only invariant is that they
 *     are valid pointers.
 *
 * 2 - Arrays always have a length argument immediately after it in the
 *     argument list.
 *
 * 3 - Some functions that takes arrays as arguments may allow NULL pointers
 *     for the array, in this case, the length argument must be 0.
 *
 * 4 - All functions that may fail are marked with MUST_USE, so the compiler
 *     will warn you if you don't check the return value.
